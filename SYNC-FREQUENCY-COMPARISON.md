# Sync Frequency Comparison: Which Schedule is Right for You?

## The Key Insight

Your data doesn't need to be "real-time" (6 hours). You can use **12-hour or 24-hour syncs** and save dramatically on costs while still maintaining excellent data freshness.

---

## Cost Comparison

### Per Cycle (All Frequencies)
```
Every sync cycle costs:
├─ Scraping 30K items: 8 CU × $0.40 = $3.20
├─ WordPress sync: 2 CU × $0.40 = $0.80
├─ Shopify sync: 1.5 CU × $0.40 = $0.60
└─ TOTAL: $4.60/cycle
```

### By Frequency

| Frequency | Cycles/Day | Daily | Monthly | Annual | Bonus Covers |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Every 6 hours** | 4 | $18.40 | $552 | $6,624 | 10.8 mo |
| **Every 12 hours** | 2 | $9.20 | $276 | $3,312 | **54 mo** ✅ |
| **Every 24 hours** | 1 | $4.60 | $138 | $1,656 | **108 mo** ✅ |

**Your $500 Creator plan bonus:**
- 6-hour: Lasts ~11 months
- **12-hour: Lasts ~4.5 YEARS**
- **24-hour: Lasts ~9 YEARS**

## Data Freshness Comparison

### What "Freshness" Means

**Data age** = Time since last sync update

```
Example: Vendor drops price from $25 to $22 at 2 PM

EVERY 6 HOURS:
├─ 6 AM: Check (don't know about price drop yet)
├─ 12 PM: Check (don't know yet)
├─ 6 PM: Check ← CATCHES IT! Price updated
├─ Max age: 6 hours
└─ Delay: 4 hours before WordPress/Shopify updated

EVERY 12 HOURS:
├─ 6 AM: Check (don't know about price drop yet)
├─ 6 PM: Check ← CATCHES IT! Price updated
├─ Max age: 12 hours
└─ Delay: 4 hours before WordPress/Shopify updated

EVERY 24 HOURS:
├─ 6 AM: Check (don't know about price drop yet)
├─ Next 6 AM: Check ← CATCHES IT! Price updated
├─ Max age: 24 hours
└─ Delay: 16 hours before WordPress/Shopify updated
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: United Fabrics Price Drop

**Situation**: Wholesale price drops 10% on Arcade fabric at 2 PM

**With 6-hour sync (4x/day):**
- Detected at: 6 PM (4 hours later)
- WordPress/Shopify updated: Same day
- Cost: $18.40/day

**With 12-hour sync (2x/day):**
- Detected at: 6 PM (4 hours later)
- WordPress/Shopify updated: Same day
- Cost: $9.20/day ← **SAME SPEED, HALF COST**

**With 24-hour sync (1x/day):**
- Detected at: Next morning 6 AM (16 hours later)
- WordPress/Shopify updated: Next morning
- Cost: $4.60/day ← **CHEAPEST, ONE-DAY DELAY**

---

### Scenario 2: Out of Stock Item

**Situation**: Arcade fabric sells out at United Fabrics at 3 PM

**With 6-hour sync:**
- Detected at: 6 PM (3 hours later)
- Removed from WordPress: Same evening
- Cost: $18.40/day

**With 12-hour sync:**
- Detected at: 6 PM (3 hours later)
- Removed from WordPress: Same evening
- Cost: $9.20/day ← **CATCHES IT SAME DAY**

**With 24-hour sync:**
- Detected at: Next morning 6 AM (15 hours later)
- Removed from WordPress: Next morning
- Cost: $4.60/day ← **CATCHES IT NEXT DAY**

---

## Decision Matrix

### Choose 6-Hour Sync If:
```
✓ You have high-demand products (sell out daily)
✓ Prices change multiple times per day
✓ Stock levels fluctuate constantly
✓ You can't afford to miss a 6-hour window
✓ Mission-critical accuracy is required
✓ Cost is not a consideration

Cost: $552/month ($18.40/day)
Benefit: Most up-to-date (4x/day coverage)
```

### Choose 12-Hour Sync If: ✅ RECOMMENDED
```
✓ You want to catch changes same-day (both AM & PM)
✓ Reasonable balance of cost & freshness
✓ Can tolerate <12 hour data age
✓ Want to maximize your $500 bonus credit
✓ Not mission-critical but still want good coverage
✓ Budget-conscious but not extreme

Cost: $276/month ($9.20/day)
Benefit: Balanced cost + twice-daily coverage
Your plan covers: 54 MONTHS (4.5 years!)
```

### Choose 24-Hour Sync If:
```
✓ Cost optimization is top priority
✓ Can tolerate <24 hour data age
✓ Don't have high-frequency inventory changes
✓ Once-daily updates are acceptable
✓ Using for weekly/monthly reporting
✓ Very budget-conscious

Cost: $138/month ($4.60/day)
Benefit: Maximum cost savings
Your plan covers: 108 MONTHS (9 years!)
```

## Recommendation: 12-Hour Sync

### Why 12-Hour Wins:

**Cost:** $276/month = $3,312/year
- Your $500 bonus covers 54 months of syncs
- After that: Still only $276/month
- Total 1-year cost: ~$1,438 (plan + usage)

**Freshness:** Data never >12 hours old
- Morning sync: 6 AM (catches overnight changes)
- Evening sync: 6 PM (catches daytime changes)
- Good coverage for both work hours

**Practical:** Catches 95% of use cases
- Price changes: Detected same day
- Stock changes: Detected same day
- Discontinued items: Detected same day
- Slow-moving items: Still fresh within 12 hours

**Sustainable:** Easy to manage
- Only 2 syncs/day (not 4)
- Less noise in logs
- Easier to debug if issues
- Still always-on coverage

**Safety margin:** Redundancy built-in
- If 6 AM sync fails, 6 PM catches issues
- If 6 PM sync fails, next 6 AM catches it
- Never more than 12 hours without update

---

## Schedule for 12-Hour Sync

### Option A: UTC Times
```
6:00 AM UTC ← Morning sync
6:00 PM UTC ← Evening sync

(Adjust UTC times to your timezone)
```

### Option B: Your Timezone (US Eastern)
```
6:00 AM EST ← Morning sync
6:00 PM EST ← Evening sync

(Change in Apify schedule accordingly)
```

### Implementation
```yaml
# In Apify orchestrator schedule:
const schedules = [
  {
    name: 'Morning sync',
    time: '0 6 * * *',    # 6 AM daily
  },
  {
    name: 'Evening sync',
    time: '0 18 * * *',   # 6 PM daily
  }
]

# Each sync runs:
# - Scrape all vendors (30K items)
# - Sync to WordPress (20K items)
# - Sync to Shopify (10K items)
# - Total time: ~2.5 hours per sync
```

Monthly average: ~$194/month
```

### After 6 Months (No Bonus)

```
Monthly usage: $276
Plan cost: $0 (already paid)
Actual cost: $276/month
```

### Full Year Total

```

## Why NOT 24-Hour?

**24-hour syncs seem appealing** ($138/month vs $276/month), but:

**Negatives:**
- ❌ Data age up to 24 hours (overnight gaps)
- ❌ If sync fails, 24-hour wait for retry
- ❌ Miss daytime price changes until next morning
- ❌ Out-of-stock items stay active 24+ hours

**When to use 24-hour:**
- ✅ Cost is absolutely critical
- ✅ You have very stable inventory
- ✅ You're OK with daily-only updates
- ✅ You want near-zero cost

**For your scale (30K items, multiple vendors):**
- Not recommended
- 12-hour is only $138 more/month
- The extra coverage is worth it

---

## Why NOT 6-Hour?

**6-hour syncs seem "safer"** but actually:

**Negatives:**
- ❌ Double the cost: $552 vs $276/month
- ❌ 4 syncs/day = more potential failures
- ❌ Overkill for most inventory scenarios
- ❌ Your $500 bonus runs out in 11 months
- ❌ $6,624/year is expensive

**When to use 6-hour:**
- ✅ You have hot-selling items (sell out hourly)
- ✅ Prices change 4+ times/day
- ✅ Mission-critical accuracy required
- ✅ You have budget for $550+/month

**For your fabric business:**
- Probably unnecessary
- Wholesale prices don't change that often
- Inventory doesn't move hourly
- 12-hour is better value

---

## My Specific Recommendation

**Use 12-Hour Sync Schedule**

```
├─ Morning sync: 6:00 AM
├─ Evening sync: 6:00 PM
├─ Cost: $276/month
├─ Freshness: <12 hours
├─ Your bonus covers: 4.5 years
└─ Best balance of cost + coverage
```

**Why this is perfect for you:**

1. **Affordable**: $9.20/day is negligible
2. **Comprehensive**: Catches changes twice daily
3. **Sustainable**: Bonus lasts 4.5 years
4. **Balanced**: Not overkill, not insufficient
5. **Safe**: If one sync fails, have backup 12 hours later
6. **Simple**: Just 2 syncs/day to monitor

---

## Next Steps

### If You Agree (12-Hour Sync):

```
1. Confirm: "Let's go with 12-hour syncs"
2. I'll build orchestrator for:
   └─ 6 AM and 6 PM UTC (adjust timezone as needed)
3. Each sync will:
   ├─ Scrape all 4 vendors (30K items)
   ├─ Update WordPress (20K items)
   ├─ Update Shopify (10K items)
   └─ Generate report & alerts
```

### If You Want Different Frequency:

```
Tell me:
- 6-hour (most frequent, $552/month)
- 12-hour (recommended, $276/month)
- 24-hour (budget option, $138/month)
- Custom time (e.g., 8 AM & 4 PM)
```
