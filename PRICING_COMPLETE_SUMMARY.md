## üîÑ How Pricing Formula Works

The system automatically calculates derived prices from wholesale:

```
Wholesale Price ‚Üí Sale Price (√ó2.5) ‚Üí Retail Price (√ó3.25)
```

**Example: Arcade**
- Wholesale: $35.00
- Sale Price: $35 √ó 2.5 = $87.50
- Retail Price: $35 √ó 3.25 = $113.75

This formula ensures consistent margin across all products.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Update Pricing

If you need to change wholesale prices:

1. **Edit PRICING_TEMPLATE.csv**
   - Open in Excel/Google Sheets
   - Update wholesale prices in the 3rd column
   - Save as CSV

2. **Run apply_pricing.js**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/richard/Desktop/Fabric\ Scraper
   node apply_pricing.js
   ```

3. **Upload new WordPress CSV**
