# Apify vs Current Playwright Setup - Detailed Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Use Current Playwright + GitHub Actions for NOW, with future path to Apify**

Your current setup is ideal for your immediate needs. Apify becomes valuable only at scale (100+ products, multiple vendors) or if you need redundancy.

---

## 1. Cost Comparison

### Current Playwright Setup (Your System)
```
GitHub Actions (Free for Public Repos):
- Public repo: FREE (unlimited runs)
- Private repo: FREE tier includes 2,000 minutes/month
  - 1 run/day × 60 min = 60 min/month → plenty of free credits

Local Cron Setup:
- Free (just uses your computer's resources)
- No cloud costs

TOTAL MONTHLY COST: $0
```

### Apify Setup
```
Free Tier:
- $5 credits/month (very limited)
- May not be enough for hourly monitoring

Starter Plan ($39/month):
- $39 in platform credits
- Suitable for ~15-20 hourly checks/month on 20 products

Professional Plan ($99-299/month):
- Better for more frequent monitoring

For Your Use Case (20 products, hourly checks):
ESTIMATED: $40-80/month minimum

TOTAL MONTHLY COST: $40-80+ (vs $0 with current setup)
```

**Cost Winner: Current Playwright Setup (100% savings)**

## 3. Implementation Effort

### Current Playwright Path
```
Steps to Always-On Real-Time Sync:
1. ✅ Already have: Scraping scripts
2. ✅ Already have: GitHub Actions setup
3. ⏳ Need: WordPress REST API integration
4. ⏳ Need: Shopify API integration
5. ⏳ Need: Auto-update logic

Estimated Time: 8-12 hours
```

### Apify Path
```
Steps to Always-On Real-Time Sync:
1. ⏳ Create Apify account & learn platform
2. ⏳ Migrate Playwright scripts to Apify format
3. ⏳ Set up Apify schedules & webhooks
4. ⏳ Integrate with WordPress REST API
5. ⏳ Integrate with Shopify API
6. ⏳ Set up alerting

Estimated Time: 24-36 hours (includes learning curve)
```

**Implementation Winner: Current Playwright Setup (2-3x faster)**

---

## 4. Scalability Analysis

### Current Playwright Setup
```
Good for: 20-100 products
Problem at: 500+ products (GitHub Actions timeout)
Scaling path: Migrate to self-hosted VM + cron
```

### Apify Setup
```
Good for: 20-10,000+ products
No scaling issues
Built-in resource management
```

**For your 20 products: Current setup is perfect**

---

## 5. Real-Time Sync Requirements

Both systems require the same additional work:

### What You Need to Build (Same for Both)

1. **WordPress REST API Integration**
   - Update product stock via `/wp-json/wc/v3/products/{id}`
   - Update prices via same endpoint
   - ~200 lines of code

2. **Shopify API Integration**
   - Update variant prices via GraphQL API
   - Update inventory via inventory adjustment endpoint
   - ~200 lines of code

3. **Sync Logic**
   - Detect changes in scraped data
   - Compare against current state in WordPress/Shopify
   - Only update if changed
   - ~150 lines of code

4. **Conflict Resolution**
   - What if product is out of stock on vendor but not on retail?
   - What if price changed mid-day on vendor?
   - Need clear rules
   - ~100 lines of code

**Neither Apify nor Playwright solves this part - you write the same code either way**

---

## 6. Detailed Recommendation

### Phase 1: NOW (Next Week)
**Use Current Playwright + GitHub Actions**

Why:
- ✅ Already built and tested
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Zero cost for current 20 products
- ✅ Can implement in ~2-3 days

What to add:
1. Enable GitHub Actions (already have .yml file)
2. Create WordPress API updater script
3. Create Shopify API updater script
4. Test with 2-3 products first

### Phase 2: Mid-Term (1-2 Months)
**Keep Current Setup, Add Features**

If you're happy with results after Phase 1:
- Set frequency to every 6 hours (not hourly yet)
- Monitor cost (still free)
- Add email alerts for stock changes
- Add dashboard for manual oversight

### Phase 3: Future (3-6 Months)
**Consider Apify Only If:**

- You have 500+ products (scalability issue)
- You need to monitor 10+ vendors simultaneously
- You want dedicated support/SLA
- Your volume justifies $40-80/month cost

---

## 7. Decision Tree

```
Do you have:
├─ 20 products? → Use Current Setup
├─ 100 products? → Still use Current Setup
├─ 500+ products? → Migrate to Apify
├─ Multiple vendors? → Apify better
└─ Need 99.9% SLA? → Apify has it, GitHub good enough otherwise
```

---

## 8. Specific Action Items for Current Setup

### To Enable Always-On Real-Time Monitoring NOW:

1. **Commit to GitHub** (Already done ✅)

2. **Add to package.json** (New scripts):
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sync:wordpress": "node sync-to-wordpress.js",
    "sync:shopify": "node sync-to-shopify.js",
    "reconcile:sync": "node run-full-reconciliation.js && npm run sync:wordpress && npm run sync:shopify"
  }
}
```

3. **Update GitHub Actions** (Edit `.github/workflows/reconciliation.yml`):
```yaml
- cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours instead of weekly
# After reconciliation, run sync scripts
- name: Sync to WordPress
  run: npm run sync:wordpress
- name: Sync to Shopify
  run: npm run sync:shopify
```

4. **Create sync-to-wordpress.js** (~200 lines):
   - Read latest vendor data
   - Compare with WordPress products
   - Update prices, stock via REST API

5. **Create sync-to-shopify.js** (~200 lines):
   - Read latest vendor data
   - Compare with Shopify products
   - Update via Shopify Admin API

6. **Test First**:
   - Run on 2-3 test products
   - Verify WordPress/Shopify update correctly
   - Then roll out to all 20 products

## 9. API Integration Guide

### WordPress REST API
```
Endpoint: https://bestupholsteryfabric.com/wp-json/wc/v3/products/{id}
Method: PUT
Auth: WooCommerce Consumer Key/Secret (generate in WordPress admin)
Fields to update:
  - regular_price (wholesale × 2.5)
  - sale_price (wholesale × 3.25)
  - stock_quantity
```

### Shopify API
```
Endpoint: https://[store].myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/graphql.json
Method: POST GraphQL
Auth: Shopify Admin API access token
Mutations:
  - productUpdate (price)
  - inventoryAdjustQuantities (stock)
```

---

## 10. Cost Breakdown Over Time

```
Current Setup (12 months):
- Every 6 hours: 4 runs/day × 30 min = 120 min/day
- 120 min/day × 30 days = 3,600 min/month (FREE tier)
- Cost: $0/month × 12 = $0 TOTAL

Apify Setup (12 months):
- Starter plan: $39/month × 12 = $468
- Or Professional: $99/month × 12 = $1,188

Savings with Current Setup: $468-1,188/year
```

---

## 11. Apify Use Cases (If You Decide to Migrate)

Consider Apify ONLY if:

1. **Scaling to 1000+ products**
   - Then: Current setup hits limits
   - Cost becomes justified

2. **Monitoring 5+ vendors simultaneously**
   - Then: Apify dashboard better

3. **Need Enterprise Support**
   - Then: Apify SLA useful

4. **Webhook-based real-time updates**
   - Then: Apify webhooks shine

For your current case (20 products, 1 vendor): None of these apply

---

## 12. Next Steps

### Week 1: Enable GitHub Actions (15 minutes)
```bash
git push  # Your code is ready
# Enable in GitHub UI: Actions → Enable GitHub Actions
# Test one run manually
```

### Week 2-3: Build WordPress Sync (4-6 hours)
```bash
# Create sync-to-wordpress.js
# Get WordPress REST API credentials
# Test with 2 products
# Deploy
```

### Week 3-4: Build Shopify Sync (4-6 hours)
```bash
# Create sync-to-shopify.js
# Get Shopify Admin API token
# Test with 2 products
# Deploy
```

### Week 5: Monitor & Optimize (ongoing)
```bash
# Watch for any sync issues
# Adjust frequency if needed
# Monitor GitHub Actions logs
```

  );

  if (!searchResp.data.length) {
    console.log(`Product ${sku} not found on WordPress`);
    return;
  }

  const product = searchResp.data[0];

  // 2. Update prices
  const salePrice = (wholesalePrice * 3.25).toFixed(2);
  const regularPrice = (wholesalePrice * 2.5).toFixed(2);

  // 3. Send update
  await axios.put(
    `${WP_URL}/wp-json/wc/v3/products/${product.id}`,
    {
      regular_price: regularPrice,
      sale_price: salePrice
    },
    { auth: { username: WP_KEY, password: WP_SECRET } }
  );

  console.log(`✓ Updated ${sku}: $${regularPrice} (regular) / $${salePrice} (sale)`);
}
```
